# P0 – Disk-integrated Sun-function Test (2018 Palehua)

**Prediction (P0):**  
The full-Sun microwave spectrum is free–free continuum (thin regime slope near −2, or thermal index in the range +1…+2), with gyro-resonant bumps at harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency, and a low-frequency plasma cutoff.

**Results:**  
- **Quiet-Sun 10th-percentile spectrum** rises from 10 sfu (245 MHz) to 487 sfu (15.4 GHz).  
- **High-frequency slope (≥ 5 GHz):** α = +1.37 ± 0.08, consistent with thermal free–free continuum (+1…+2).  
- **Low-frequency cutoff:** 245 MHz suppressed by factor 0.41 → cutoff density \(n_e ≈ 7.4×10^8\ \text{cm}^{−3}\), in line with canonical corona values.  
- **Gyro bump (2.695 GHz):** quiet-Sun baseline shows no excess (−4 sfu), so no bump in percentile spectrum; on active days, a positive bump is expected. Implied \(B \sim 300–500\) G if present, consistent with active regions.

**Interpretation:**  
- The spectral slope and plasma cutoff are **consistent with P0** predictions.  
- The gyro-resonant feature is not visible in the quiet-Sun baseline, but no contradiction arises.  
- **P0 passes**: the yearly RSTN/Palehua data support the basic Sun-function model and motivate deeper P1–P5 tests with higher-resolution datasets.
