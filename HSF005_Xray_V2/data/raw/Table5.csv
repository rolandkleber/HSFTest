#: name: Table 5
#: description: The derived hadronic total and inelastic cross sections. The quoted systematic (sys) errors are from
the uncertainty in the T dependence, normalization, luminosity and rho (the ratio of the real/imaginary parts of the hadronic scattering
amplitude at T=0), respectively. The statistical errors are shown as zero:.
